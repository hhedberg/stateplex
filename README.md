What is Stateplex?
------------------

Stateplex is a server-side C++ actor model library released under the LGPL
open source software license. The aim is to provide fast and reliable
implementations of various communication protocols and data storage
to be exploited in domain specific application development.

A naive example is a back-end for a web service, which requires HTTP and
WebSocket protocols as well as JSON data storage.
